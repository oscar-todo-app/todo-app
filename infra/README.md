The terraform / infra files are split in two folders.
    - Cluster takes care of:
        - Creating the db
        - Creating the VPC
        - Creating the cluster
        - Creating the necessary permissions into the cluster.
        - Installs argocd
        - Creates db pass secrets.
    - Repo takes care of:
        - Creating the ECR repo where we can store the image
        - Making the iam and oidc permissions so we can push from github actions.
